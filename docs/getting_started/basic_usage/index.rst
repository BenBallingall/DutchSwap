Basic usage
===========

The main draw of our site is auctions. For auction creators, this is the place where you have the opportunity to create your token, set the initial and final prices and the dates of the auction. Once you are done with this, Dutch Swapâ€™s algorithm can take over and provide a smooth auction for your token.

For everyone participating, the process of trading will be efficient, inclusive and equitable. At auction, the DutchSwap protocol seamlessly trades, or "swaps", your token for any existing ERC20 Token and ensures all the necessary transferals take place. 

You can follow this link to learn more about the mechanism `here <https://gitter.im/dutchswap/community>`_
More information about the tokens usage can be found in our documentation: :ref:`tokens`_
