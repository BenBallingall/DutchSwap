Basic usage
===========

The main component of our site is auctions. This is the place where you have the opportunity to create your so-called token, set the initial and final prices for it and select the dates of the trading. Once you are done with this, you started your auction and made it possible for Dutch Swapâ€™s algorithm to take control on your sales.

Thanks to this algorithm, the process of trading process will be efficient, inclusive and equitable. You can follow this link to learn more about the mechanism `here <https://gitter.im/dutchswap/community>`_

Now you need to decide what exactly you want to sell. From here, you need to know such a thing as Token. This is exactly the unit that you will trade.

You can choose an option from the existing Tokens, which are based on the ERC20 technology, or create your own free one, which can be traded in this way.

More information about the tokens usage you can find by the link in our documentation: :ref:`tokens`_
