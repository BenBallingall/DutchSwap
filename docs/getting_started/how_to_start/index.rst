How to Start
============

Here is where real things have a place to be started. To start trading on DutchSwap, you need to register your own account and link your personal Ethereum wallet to it. 


We highly recommend you to use Metamask as a wallet keeper. This service established itself as high-quality and secure software.

Once you possess your wallet with Ethereum currency, make sure that you have connected it to Dutch Swap account.

When this completely simple steps will be passed, for now you are ready to start making money.

From here you can create your own auction and start trading, or create a special ERC20 Token.
