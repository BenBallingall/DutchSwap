Auction Process
===============

We believe that the market should determine the price of a token rather than you or I. The Dutch Auction mechanism achieves this fairness for two main reasons. First, at every auction everyone who buys a token, buys it at the same price. Second, the market determines that price itself. 


These are exactly the characteristics that people believe for and choose exactly Dutch auctions. Although they are not yet so popular in the world, they have already proven themselves well in the field of business and trade in particular.


Why is that? Because this type of auction solves the following problems:

    - The seller recognizes their fullest economic benefits from the sale
    - Descending prices ensure bidders will bill promptly when their internal price is reached
    - Quick and simple to implement, easy to understand for bidders
    - Everything is done out in the open, transparency to everyone involved


How it Works
============

Every Dutch auction has a set amount of tokens available to be bought. 
Prices start high and are dropped successively until a bidder accepts the going price. Once a price is accepted, the auction ends.

.. note::

    **For example, the auctioneer starts at $2,000 for an object. The bidders watch the price decline until it reaches a price that one of the bidders accepts. No bidder sees the othersâ€™ bids until after his or her own bid is formulated, and the winning bidder is the one with the highest bid. So, if there are no bidders at $2,000, the price is lowered by $100 to $1,900. If a bidder accepts the item of interest at, say the $1,500 mark, the auction ends.**


The biggest benefit of such auctions is that they are meant to democratize public offerings. As it happens currently, the process for conducting a typical IPO is mostly controlled by investment banks.

Set Up
======

Each dutch auction is defined by a start and end time, starting and minimum token price and the number of tokens to be sold.
From this, the linear pricing is determined auction begins automatically.
Users are invited to contribute funds as soon as the start time begins.
