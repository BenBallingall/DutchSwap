What is a Dutch Auction
===============

We believe that the market should determine the price of a token rather than you or I. The Dutch Auction mechanism achieves this fairness for two main reasons. First, at every auction everyone who buys a token, buys it at the same price. Second, the market determines that price itself. 


These are exactly the characteristics that people believe for and choose exactly Dutch auctions. Although they are not yet so popular in the world, they have already proven themselves well in the field of business and trade in particular.


Why would I need a Dutch Auction?
----------------------------------
Because this type of auction solves the following problems:

    - The fairest method for selling more than one of the same object, period.
    - Descending prices ensure bidders will bid early, and honestly. 
    - Lowest bid price for all winners means people commit what they think it is worth, yet likely to get it cheaper.
    - Everything is done out in the open, transparency to everyone involved.



How a Dutch Auction Works
-------------------------

Every Dutch auction has a set amount of tokens available to be bought. 
The price is initially set at a high price and during the auction continues to drop. 
The price drops until either all the tokens are sold, or hits a minimum price. 


.. note::

    **For example, the auctioneer starts at $2,000 for an object. The bidders watch the price decline until it reaches a price that one of the bidders accepts. No bidder sees the othersâ€™ bids until after his or her own bid is formulated, and the winning bidder is the one with the highest bid. So, if there are no bidders at $2,000, the price is lowered by $100 to $1,900. If a bidder accepts the item of interest at, say the $1,500 mark, the auction ends.**


The biggest benefit of such auctions is that they are meant to democratize public offerings. As it happens currently, the process for conducting a typical IPO is mostly controlled by investment banks.



Other Dutch Auctions 
--------------------

This work was inspired by the Google IPO which was a dutch auction by OpenIPO and both the Algorand and Gnosis dutch auctions.
More details on the Algorand auction mechanism can be found here: `Algo Auction <https://algorand.foundation/algo-auctions>`_ 
We do not support the Algorand refund vault but will do so in v2.
