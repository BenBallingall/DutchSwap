Auction Process
===============

To set up your auction you need to proceed through some pretty simple actions. Really, itâ€™s fairly easy to start trading using Dutch Swap.

Start from the beginning. When you open the corresponding tab with the creation of an auction, you will be greeted by the first field required to fill in. This field is your token. If one already exists, just start typing its name or symbol in the input field and select it from the drop-down list and continue working. 

.. note::

    If no such token exists, create one. The creation process is described in a separate paragraph of the documentation.
