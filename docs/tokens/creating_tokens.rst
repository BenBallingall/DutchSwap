Creating Tokens
===================

Most ERC20 tokens can be used as the sale token in a Dutch Auction. 

It’s a pretty simple action that could be done just in a few clicks.

The most important step towards recognition was the possibility to create one’s own custom Dutch Swap token. That gave an opportunity to dozens of projects to see life thanks to additional flexibility of auctions. Now everyone can create their own token with a unique name and fully manage it.

::

    To create your one follow the next steps:

        - Visit the appropriative page on Dutch Swap
        - Enter the reliable values of your token, such as name, symbol, and decimals
        - Click the Mint button to create your custom token

    .. note::

        Note that your Ropsten network address will be automatically fetched from your account.

Setting Up
==========


The token is one of the most important components of smart contracts.

::

    To setup a token, you need to enter the required data in the appropriate fields. 

        - It starts with entering Token’s name - should be the unique value(such as Tether, Chainlink).
        - After that put in a symbol associated with your token. It should be in uppercase and consist not more than from 3 symbols
        - In the next step, you have the option to set decimals. It defines digits in the fraction part. Recommended value is not less than 9

    .. note::

        After creating your special token, you will be able to use it directly in newly created auctions


Exceptions
==========
Some exceptions include deflationary tokens where there is a difference in total value when transfered, usually from a transfer at the protocol level.
