Quickstart
==========

This page provides a quick overview of DutchSwap. It relies mostly on examples and assumes a level of familiarity with smart contract dvelopment. 
For more in-depth content, you should read the documentation sections under "Getting Started" in the table of contents.

DutchSwap is a smart contract framework for creating Dutch Auctions on Ethereum.

.. note::

    This framework is based on swapping ETH or ERC20 tokens in batches using a Dutch auction mechanism. To fully understand the documentation of the solution outlined, you must have a basic knowledge of what a ERC20 token is and how to use Ethereum

The main idea of a Dutch auction is to determine a fair price for a batch of the items. The same item to be specific. 400 years ago it would have been batches of tulips. Today, tokens with no previous price are a perfect, as they will allow for price discovery by the end of the auction. 



1 - Creating a New Token
========================


The first step to using DutchSwap is having a token to sell.

.. note::
    If you already have some ERC20 tokens you wish to sell, continue to step 2.

To mint your own new ERC20 token, you need to do the following.


- Connect your wallet using metamask

- Enter your Token’s name - should be unique string.
- Add a symbol associated with your token. It should be in all uppercase and 3-5 symbols long (ie TKN)
- Set a total supply. This will be the number of tokens you mint initially. 



After creating your ERC20 tokens, you will be able to sell some of them in a Dutch auction. 




2 - Starting a Dutch Auction
============================

The first step for you, as for seller is to have a token you wish to sell. To do that you only need to follow the next steps.

    - To create an auction, first of all you need to create your account. Click a Signup button and follow the instructions. It’s as simple as that.
    - Each auction is based on a close relationship with the cryptocurrency. Therefore, you need to connect your account with Ethereum wallet. If you don't have your personal Ethereum wallet yet, you need to create it. To do this, we recommend following the documentation of `Metamask <https://metamask.io/>`_. It is the fastest, most reliable and easiest way to start your business.
    - Whether you did this simple setup, you are able to create your first auction. Click the appropriate tab on the left side of the screen. You will see a window indicating the following steps required to create an auction.
    - The first thing you need to enter is a Token. Token - particular fungible and tradable asset or a utility created over an initial coin offering. If you don’t have one yet, you should create it first.
    - Here where your own data should come to place. Decide what should be the best approach for your business and fill the fields:
        - Amount - quantity of token supply that you want to sell.
        - Prices - set the starting price and the end one for your offer.
        
        .. note::

            Remember that the starting price must be higher than the ending price.
        
        - Dates - pick appropriative dates for your auction
    - Congratulation on this! Now you have created your auction and have full access to its data. Change it whatever it needed and manage your business with comfort.
