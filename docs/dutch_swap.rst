Dutch Auctions
==============


We believe that the market should determine the price of a token rather than you or I. 
The Dutch Auction mechanism achieves this fairness for two main reasons. 
First, at every auction everyone who buys a token, buys it at the same price. 
Second, the market determines that price. 


How a Dutch Auction Works
=========================

Every Dutch auction has a set amount of tokens available to be bought. 
The price is initially set at a high price and during the auction continues to drop. 
The price drops until either all the tokens are sold, or hits a minimum price.

This work was inspired by both the Algorand and Gnosis dutch auctions.
